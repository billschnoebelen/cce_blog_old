I wanted to test pull out strength of bolts with my shop press. I needed something to give an indication of force. I bought the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/2-1-2-Pressure-Gauge-Stainless-Steel-Case-Liquid-Filled-Back-Mnt-10000-PSI/184555160592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheapest gauge on ebay</a>. It is a Harbor Freight press so they will get along well. It is a pretty decent gauge!

I started to disassemble the jack. This took a LOT of force.

There was dirt and loose burrs inside the unit. These are clearly made at a price point. Machining finish, deburring, and cleaning are not of concern. Most likely this will collect and sit in the reservoir for the life of the jack.

The cylinder was about 1/4" thick DOM. I got it off with a pipe wrench, but it really fought me. A chain wrench would have been a better choice. Chain wrenches, however, cost more than 1/2 what I paid for the bottle jack.

You could see the marks under the paint for the internal porting. I needed a 1/4 NPT tap and my own port to the cylinder bore which avoids any existing ports. Since I was dealing with very large forces, it would also be nice if I did not crack the base!

I laid it out in CAD. I went with an 1/8" shallow hole in the cylinder base. The 1/4" NPT holes has a 3/16" port which meets up with the 1/8" hole. There is plenty of meat where nothing is going to break. The gauge piping is all schedule 80 or better.

They gave me new seals when I bought the jack so I installed them. The piston is a simple cup seal with backup o-ring. My guess is it does not seal air very well. I would think this helps bleed air out of the normally upright cylinder.

I cleaned everything up. I removed my burrs as well as some other. The scratches won't hurt anything.

The numbers:

    Radius = 56mm/25.4/2 = 1.102in
    Area = 3.14\*1.102in^2 = 3.82in^2

    Theoretical
    Force = 20T \* 2000lbs/T = 40,000lbs
    PSI = 40,000lbs/3.82in^2 = 10,471lbs/in^2

    Actual (pressure relief trips between 7-8 kpsi)
    Force = 8000lbs/in^2 \* 3.82in^2 = 30,560
    30,560/2000 = 15.28T`

A 20 Ton bottle jack will not produce 20 Ton of force. There is a built in safety factor.
